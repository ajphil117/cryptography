# Cryptography Projects
Over the course of 12 weeks, I explored the cryptanalysis of historical ciphers, information theory for cryptography, stream ciphers, block ciphers, modes of operation, cryptography applications, and public key cryptography. Learning these concepts helped me to improve my skills in securing data.

A further outline of all cryptography methods and theories explored can be seen below.

## Methods and Theory Explored in Each Project
### A1: Cryptanalysis of Historical Ciphers, Information Theory for Cryptography
Historical ciphers:
- Simple random substitution cipher
- Vigenère Cipher
- Simple transposition cipher
- 2x2 hill cipher

Information Theory:
- Perfect secrecy of constrained historical ciphers
- Entropy and conditional entropy

### A2: Stream and Block Ciphers, Modes of Operation, Applications
- LSFRs
- Block modes and cipher linearity
- Message authentication codes
- Using block ciphers for hash functions
- Proofs of work

### A3: Public Key Cryptography
Number theory:
- Bézout’s identity

RSA Encryption:
- Squares-and-Multiply algorithm
- Chinese remainder theorem

Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement:
- Fermat's little theorem
- Passive and active attacks

Elliptic-Curve Cryptography:
- Elliptic-curve arithmetic
- Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement
